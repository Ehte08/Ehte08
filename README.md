# Mohammed Baquer

Data scientist from New York. I build ML systems end-to-end — scraped data to deployed model — and document them so the work is reproducible and the results speak for themselves.

B.S. Applied Mathematics & Statistics + Technology Management, Stony Brook University. Starting my **M.S. in Data Science at Hofstra** in August 2026. **Open to Fall 2026 internships in Machine Learning, Data Science, Generative AI, and Analytics.**

## Projects

### [F1 Race Outcome Predictor](https://github.com/Ehte08/F1-Predictor)
Learning-to-rank model that predicts Formula 1 podium finishes — **NDCG@3 of 0.91**, Spearman 0.67 on a chronological hold-out — using LightGBM trained on 8 seasons of Grand Prix data. The pipeline runs FastF1 + Ergast ingestion, Optuna hyperparameter search (30 trials), and MLflow experiment tracking, with a FastAPI REST endpoint and Streamlit dashboard on top. Leak-free rolling feature snapshots. Full pytest suite.

### [Superhero Detector](https://github.com/Ehte08/Computer-Vision-Projects/tree/main/Superhero-detector)
Image classifier hitting **94% top-1 accuracy** across 10 Marvel and DC heroes, fine-tuned from ResNet50. I built the full pipeline: scraped and deduplicated ~3,900 images, then watched the transfer learning gains stack up — TinyCNN at 55%, ResNet18 at 89%, ResNet50 at 94%. Live Gradio demo with hardware-aware inference across Apple MPS, CUDA, and CPU.

### [GenAI Chatbot](https://github.com/Ehte08)
Generative AI chatbot that brought response times down from 4–6 hours to under 10 minutes, deflecting a significant volume of support tickets. Built on top of an LLM with a retrieval layer for grounding answers in internal documentation.

### [Data Automation Pipeline](https://github.com/Ehte08)
Replaced two days of manual reporting with same-day delivery — automated ingestion, transformation, and output across 10K+ rows of operational data using Python and SQL.

### [PinchToHeart](https://github.com/Ehte08/Computer-Vision-Projects/tree/main/PinchToHeart)
Real-time CV app that detects a pinch gesture via webcam and fires a heart emoji over iMessage — no third-party APIs, just MediaPipe's 21-point 3D hand landmarks with a depth-aware false-positive filter running natively on macOS.

## In progress

**Bone Fracture Detection (YOLOv8)** — object detection on X-ray data, from annotation to mAP evaluation with a full writeup.

**RAG Agent** — end-to-end retrieval-augmented generation system with LangChain, a vector store, and an evaluation framework for retrieval quality and hallucination rate.

**Causal Inference study** — Difference-in-Differences with parallel-trends validation, robustness checks, and event-study plots on a public-policy dataset.

## Right now I'm digging into

LLM fine-tuning, agentic AI workflows with LangGraph, and LLM evaluation and safety frameworks. Also experimenting with LLM-driven code optimization over at [openevolvetest](https://github.com/Ehte08/openevolvetest).
